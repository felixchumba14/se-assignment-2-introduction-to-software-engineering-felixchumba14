What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software engineering is a systematic, disciplined, and quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software.
It encompasses the entire software development lifecycle (SDLC), including requirements analysis, design, implementation, testing, deployment, maintenance, and retirement while traditional programming  involves developing small-scale or individual components of a software application without necessarily considering the broader SDLC.
Software engineering uses structured methodologies like Waterfall, Agile, Scrum, DevOps, etc., to manage and execute projects while traditional programming uses informal or no specific methodologies, relying on the programmer's discretion and experience.
Software engineering places significant emphasis on understanding and meeting user requirements through thorough analysis and design while traditional programming primarily concerns with implementing specific functionalities and features as efficiently as possible using codes.
Software engineering adheres to ethical standards and practices to ensure software safety, security, and privacy while traditional programming focuses on optimizing algorithms and code for performance and efficiency.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
It is a structured process used for developing software applications. It consists of a series of defined phases that guide the software development process from inception to retirement. The SDLC ensures timely delivery, cost control, quality assurance, resource management and risk management. 

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Initiation phase:
 Determining the objectives, goals and feasibility of the project.
 Identification of the stakeholders in the project.

Planning phase:
It involves project planning, resource allocation, risk analysis, and schedule estimation which should yield project plan, feasibility study, and initial requirements.

Execution phase:
It involves assigning of risks to members, implementation of the project plans and mangement of the teams.

Monitoring and controlling phase:
It involves project tracking, quality control, change of schedule scope and report performances.

Closure phase:
It inlvolves finalization, obtaining formal acceptance, releasing project resources and documenting lessons learned for future improvemens.

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
Agile model is an iterative and incremental approach for project management while Waterfall model is a linear sequencial approach where each step is done ata time before the next.

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
In Waterfall model changes are difficult and costly to implement once a phase is completed while Agile model easily accommodates changes and new requirements even late in the development process.
In Agile model, each iteration includes planning, design, coding, testing and review while in Waterfall model the typical phases include Requirements Analysis, Design, Implementation (Coding), Testing, Deployment and Maintenance.
In Waterfall model, there is high risk if initial requirements are wrong; issues found late while in Agile model there is lower risk due to early and continuous testing and feedback.
NOTE:
Waterfall model is better for projects with well-defined, unchanging requirements.
Agile model is suitable for complex projects with evolving requirements.

Requirements Engineering:
 it is the process of defining, documenting, and maintaining the requirements for a software system. The main goal of requirements engineering is to ensure that the software being developed meets the needs and expectations of its users and stakeholders.

 Describe the process and importance of requirements engineering in the software development lifecycle.
Requirements Elicitation:
Involves gathering requirements from stakeholders, including end-users, customers, and other parties with an interest in the system using interviews, surveys, questionnaires, focus groups, observations, document analysis, use cases, and user stories.

Requirements Analysis and Negotiation:
Involves analyzing and prioritizig the gathered requirements to ensure they are feasible, consistent, complete, and aligned with business objectives using the requirements workshops, brainstorming sessions, prototyping, modeling, and scenario analysis by identifying dependencies, resolving conflicts between requirements, and ensuring all requirements are clear and unambiguous.

Requirements Specification:
Involves documenting the requirements in a clear, precise, and comprehensive manner using the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) documents, user stories, use case diagrams, and functional specificationsand following standards such as IEEE 830 to ensure quality and consistency in the documentation.

Requirements Validation
Entails ensuring that the documented requirements accurately reflect the stakeholders' needs and that they are feasible and testable using reviews, inspections, walkthroughs, and prototyping by checking for completeness, consistency, feasibility, and ensuring that all requirements can be verified through testing.

Requirements Management
Involves managing changes to the requirements throughout the project lifecycle to ensure the software remains aligned with business needs using version control, traceability matrices, change control boards, and impact analysis by tracking requirement changes, assessing the impact of changes, and maintaining requirement traceability.

Software Design Principles:
Software design principles are guidelines that help developers create systems that are maintainable, scalable, efficient, and easy to understand. These principles are essential in creating robust and high-quality software.

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Modularity is a design principle in software engineering that involves dividing a software system into distinct, independent, and interchangeable components called modules. Each module encapsulates a specific piece of functionality or a subset of the system's behavior, interacting with other modules through well-defined interfaces. This concept is fundamental to creating complex and maintainable software systems.
I t improves maintainability by isolation of Changes,simplified Testing,focused Development,clear Organization and enhanced Debugging.
It improves scalability by parallel development, independent scaling, incremental updates, reusable components and decoupled architecture.

Testing in Software Engineering:
 It involves evaluating the software to detect and fix bugs, verify functionality, and ensure that the product is reliable, secure, and performs well under different conditions.

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Unit Testing: test individual components or units of the software to ensure they function correctly in isolation.
Integration Testing: test the interactions between integrated units or components to ensure they work together as expected.
System Testing: test the complete and integrated software system to verify that it meets the specified requirements.
Acceptance Testing: Validate the system's readiness for delivery to the end-users by ensuring it meets user requirements and is acceptable for release.

Importance of Testing
Quality Assurance: Ensures that the software meets quality standards and user expectations.
Bug Detection: Identifies and fixes defects before the software is released, reducing the risk of failure in production.
User Satisfaction: Improves user satisfaction by delivering a reliable and functional product.
Cost Efficiency: Early detection of bugs reduces the cost and effort required to fix them later in the development cycle.
Compliance: Ensures the software complies with industry standards, regulations, and legal requirements

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
They are software tools that track changes to files and directories over time. They allow developers to manage and collaborate on codebases, enabling them to keep track of changes, revert to previous versions, and merge changes from multiple contributors.
Importance of Version Control Systems
History Tracking: VCS keeps a complete history of changes made to files, allowing developers to review past revisions, understand the evolution of the codebase, and identify when and why specific changes were made.

Collaboration: VCS facilitates collaboration among developers by providing a centralized repository where team members can share and work on code simultaneously. It allows multiple developers to work on different features or branches of the codebase without interfering with each other's work.

Conflict Resolution: VCS helps resolve conflicts that arise when multiple developers modify the same file simultaneously. It provides mechanisms for merging changes and resolving conflicts in a controlled and systematic manner.

Code Reusability: VCS promotes code reusability by enabling developers to create branches, experiment with new features, and merge successful changes back into the main codebase. It also allows for the reuse of code across different projects or teams.

Backup and Disaster Recovery: VCS serves as a backup mechanism for codebases, ensuring that valuable code is not lost due to accidental deletions, hardware failures, or other disasters. Developers can always revert to previous versions in case of emergencies.
